Hello and welcome to the I'm Bored web app.

It's simple to use. Just follow the instructions on screen to enter your name. Then click the Find Something To Do button. If you like
the idea, click on the idea phrase and you'll be shown a map with marks indicating where you can do that fun thing. Click on any of the
marks and you'll get a detailed pop-up window, as well as a listing to the left of the map with the name, address, phone and website of
the fun thing to do.

Each time you click something fun to do, that activity will also be added to the nav bar drop down menus at the top right of your screen.
To refer to any of you fun things, you can always go to that drop down and your fun thing will be reposted to the top of your list of
fun things to do.

If you don't like the first idea that pops, click the Something Else button and we'll keep finding fun things for you to do. As you click
things you think look good, they'll be added to the top of the table with details on the left and your map with markers on the right.

Don't worry about clicking an idea more than once each time it pops up. An idea only gets added to the table and the nav bar submenu
once each time it appears.

Enjoy - and keep looking for fun things to do!
